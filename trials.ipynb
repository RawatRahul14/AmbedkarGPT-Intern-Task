      "The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, described in terms of a set of input-output pairs. The primary aim is to infer a general rule that maps inputs to appropriate outputs, based on the example inputs and outputs that are given during the training phase.\n",

Machine learning algorithms are categorized as supervised learning (where the output is known), unsupervised learning (where only the input is known), semi-supervised learning (a combination of both), and reinforcement learning (which involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal).\n",
